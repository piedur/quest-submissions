1) The five Cadence programming languages pillars are 1) safety and security; 2) clarity; 3) approachability; 4) developer experience; 5) resource oriented programming.

2) without knowing anything about the Blockchain and coding I think that those above mentioned five pillars are useful because: 1) safety and security is important in
every aspect of life; 2) clarity also is important, I think that even difficult things can be made easy to read and understand; 3) approachability is useful so people
with knowledge on other programming languages can quickly orient themselves; 4) good developer experience is useful because everyone can faster learn Cadence.
