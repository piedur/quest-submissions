1) structs can be made in scripts, structs can be copied and overwritten, structs better cooperate with arrays and dictionaries(?)

2) for creating and transfering NFT

3) create

4) resource can only be created in a contract.

5) I do not know if this will be right answer: the resource type is 'Jacob' and also the resource name is 'Jacob'.

6)
@Jacob insted of just Jacob
<- create instead of =
return <- myJacob instead of return myJacob
