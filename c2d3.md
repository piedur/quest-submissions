3) force unwrap operator ! changes the value String? to value String when we are
returning a value from a dictionary.

4) This error message means that we can only return a String value and we
can not return a String? (which is an optional) value. We are getting
this error message because we are allways returning from dictionaries 
values as optionals. To fix this we need to force-unwrap and put "!" in the end.
"return thing[0x03]!"
